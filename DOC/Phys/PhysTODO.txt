--- Test 1:
1. Complex collision for skel. mesh - how to enable / disable?

--- Collision Test 0:
When moving bone - will it move some actor that is on top of that?

--- Phys Test 1:
Make a ragdoll skel mesh
1. Simple ragdoll test (+DONE)
Q. Can we make different parts with different physics enable state?

--- Phys Test 2:
Make collidable bodies, influence force on specific bone


--- Info:
1. Constraints - what is it?
2. Aggregates of physics bodies - what is it?
3. Profiles?

---- Physics body properties:
1. Physics type: Simulated or kinematic + Default
HINT: Use Kinematic type to make some body part NOT to repond physically!

2. Simulation generates hit events
Q. Will it generates hit events when TWO bodies of the SAME skel mesh are COLLIDED?

--- Demo controls:
1. Asserting force to specific bone (up, down, etc.)
2. Show/Enumerate physics bodies of the selected mesh
